## Process



- [Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/areitan/Password_Generator)
- [Password Generator]()


### Thinking Through The Problem

1. The first step I took was to start pseudo-coding. I wanted to get my thought process down on paper and then attempt to write the code from there.


### Popup Boxes

1. alert
2. prompt box for number of characters
3. confirm boxes for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
4. Turned boxes into functions to write user preferences to console
5. Added while loop to password length to force use to pick length within specified range.


### Arrays

1. I add an array for numbers beginning with 0 and ending at 9.
2. I add an array for uppercase letters.
3. I add an array for lowercase letters.
2. I add an array for special characters.




### Functions







## How To Contribute

As always suggestions are welcome. I have used the methods I have at hand at the moment, but there are many ways to get to the same end. There may be a more elegant way to write th is code, and input is welcome.
